<h2>What is Volleyball?</h2>
       <p>Volleyball is a team sport played between two teams of six players each, on a rectangular court divided by a net. The objective is to score points by grounding the ball on the opponent's court. Each team can touch the ball up to three times to return it over the net to the opponent's side, with common techniques including passing, setting, and spiking (attacking). The game is fast-paced, requiring teamwork, agility, and strategic thinking to win points and ultimately the match. It's a popular sport worldwide, both in recreational settings and competitive leaguest.</p>
